### A colection of scripts we use regularly.   

  * tidy_names : Read a FASTA file containing isoforms, where the headers (previously taken from a GFF file) include the IDs for the protein, mRNA, and gene. The script generates a new FASTA file with cleaned headers, where only the gene ID is shown. In cases where there are isoforms, only the longest sequence is included.
